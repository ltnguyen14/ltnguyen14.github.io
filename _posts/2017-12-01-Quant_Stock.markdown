description: A stock analysis/prediction model using machine learning
---

This was my senior thesis, which basically compare the effectiveness of three different neural network models - feedforward, recursion, and convolutional neural network. The model measure the impact between different out-of-the-market factors (weather, oil prices, etc.) and applicable stock prices. This project is built using Python.

Here is the flow graph for the project:
