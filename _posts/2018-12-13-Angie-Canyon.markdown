description: Simple Unity game
---

This is a simple game that I made using Unity, mainly to learn more about C# and how a scripting language work in the context of a game engine. I also learned about the entity system, and have implemented it in the Survival engine that I later made, before switching to ECS (I admit I started using ECS because of all the hype surrounding it, but then quickly fell in love with the idea). The game is not well-optimized and is unfinished, since I mostly see it as an experiment to better my understanding on how game engine works.

Here is a short video to see the game in action:
