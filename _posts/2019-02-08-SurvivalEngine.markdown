Survival Engine is one of my many attempts at creating a game engine from scratch. While calling it from scratch, I do rely on some external libraries such as GLFW, GLM and stb_image. The engine is made using C++ and OpenGL, and is capable of doing both 2D and 3D rendering, but focusing much more on 2D.

Here is an example where I used this engine to create a Minescraft-like terrain generator using Perlin Noise:

Simple movement and lighting system:
