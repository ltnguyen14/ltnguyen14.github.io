description: A game engine written almost from scratch using C-style C++ and OpenGL
---

This is an on-going project and is possibly my proudest work so far. The project mark the first time that I ever written platform code (even though I still use GLFW) and also the first time that I integrate ECS into one of my projects. There is not a whole lot of demo-able things that I can show here yet except from a few screenshots of sprites on the screen (which is boring), since I really focused on low-level programming here and tried to ensure to get the best performance I could from the engine. 

This is a project full of experimentations, since I decided to switch to using a more procedure focused style of programming. I'm definitely not saying OOP is bad, since it can certainly be useful in certain scenarios, but I found this to be a much more natural approach to programming in general. I also tried to focus on using data driven design, and found it to be a very interesting concept.
