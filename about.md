<p>Hi, I'm Lam! I've been working with software since I was around 12 years old when my dad first introduced me to Pascal, and currently am a software engineer at Angie's List, Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Around the age of 17, I started learning C/C++ and soon grew an interest in game engine development and game programming in general. 
  Since being introduced to the <a href="https://handmade.network/">Handmade Network</a> my college senior year (which admittedly wasn't that long ago), I started to fall in love with low level programming and game engine development.</p>

<p>I spend most of my free time learning about and making game engines, mostly with C/C++ - even though I did attempt to make one in Python, which didn't end up too well for me :)</p>
